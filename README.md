# üéÆÔ∏è PS5 Nor Modifier

The PS5 NOR Modifier is a Windows GUI-based application making it easier for people to modify the NOR file for their PlayStation 5 console. This is especially useful if you need to generate a NOR file for your console to replace a corrupt or faulty NOR.

## üõ†Ô∏è Install

- Download compiled versions under the [releases section](https://github.com/TheCod3rYouTube/PS5NorModifier/releases/tag/release)
- If you just want to use the software, download the **standalone ZIP** version.

## ‚ùì Explanation

Some symptoms that your NOR is corrupt or faulty:

1. No power at all. The console draws 8 mA of current or 0 mA of current when connecting to a bench power supply
2. 3 beeps of death. The console beeps 3 times when you plug in the main power cord
3. Cannot update the console

This is also useful if you cannot update the console because the disc drive IC is either faulty, or if you don't have a matching disc drive for your motherboard. You can convert your NOR dump from a disc edition to digital edition to "fool" the PS5 during
an update. This will allow an update to go through and will not harm the console. If you do somehow get the disc drive working at a later date you would need to convert the console back, along with the matching serial number.
