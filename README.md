A Windows GUI application to simplify NOR file modification for PlayStation 5 consoles.

The PS5 NOR Modifier is a Windows GUI-based application making it easier for people to modify the NOR file for their PlayStation 5 console. This is especially useful if you need to generate a NOR file for your console to replace a corrupt or faulty NOR.

## ‚ùì Explanation

### Signs of a corrupt or faulty NOR:

1. No power at all. The console draws 8 mA of current or 0 mA of current when connecting to a bench power supply
2. 3 beeps of death. The console beeps 3 times when you plug in the main power cord
3. Cannot update the console

### Special use cases:

If your disc drive IC is faulty or you don't have a matching disc drive for your motherboard, you can convert your NOR dump from a disc edition to a digital edition.  
This "fools" the PS5 during an update and allows the update to proceed safely.  
If you later repair or replace the disc drive, you'll need to convert the console back and restore the matching serial number.
