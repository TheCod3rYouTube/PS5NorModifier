Some symptoms that your NOR is corrupt or faulty:
1. No power at all. The console draws 8ma of current or 0ma of current when connecting to a bench power supply
2. 3 beeps of death. The console beeps 3 times when you plug in the main power chord
3. Cannot update the console

This is also useful if you cannot update the console because the disc drive IC is either faulty, or if you don't have a matching disc drive for your motherboard. You can convert your NOR dump from a disc edition to digital edition to "fool" the PS5 during
an update. This will allow an update to go through and will not hurt the console. If you do somehow get the disc drive working at a later date you would need to convert the console back, along with the matching serial number.
